# NotesTakingApp
This was the first project I ever made using Java on my first year of University for my Object Oriented Programming.
It allows students to take notes for the different modules that they have in their course. 
The app allows students to add, edit and delete either course, modules and notes.
Courses can be added to a drop down list togther with different modules that are linked to that specific course.
